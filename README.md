# Microservice Implementation

## Project description

The goal is the development of an microservice that is made available to all fellow students and colleagues 
at the DKE using the OLIVE microservice framework on the DKE server. Our microservice returns "Points of Interest" 
based on your current address and a selected category. The microservice should receive a place as input 
and return the categories of the places in a given radius of the area. Than a search for a specific category can be made,
which then outputs the exact locations and makes them available to the user.



## Project implemetation

Development of a new microservice in the OLIVE framework is separated in two sub-tasks:


### Sub-task 1 - Conception 

	
<details>
<summary>Design thinking and modelling</summary>
<p>
Development and presentation of an expos√© which represents our microservice. In addition, potential applications of microservices
are listed and detailed, and possible combinations with microservices from other groups are considered. Furthermore, the implementation 
of the service is planned and individual components of the application are modeled. In addition, APIs that are required for the implementation
 of the microservices are found and described.
